For lab 1, I did a very simple project including the main Godot logo sprite, a variation of it, and a sprite of a monkey picture I had on my computer. I also decided to use a png of grass as a background. Within the grass are instances of doors within another scene that I made to look as if they were embedded into the grass. This project helped me learn how to get a grasp on creating scenes from objects, creating objects in Godot, and learning how a single object can be changed within the scene it originates from.
